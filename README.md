This App is for Persona 5 Royal (PC) Modding.

The purpose of this app is to be a more user-friendly way of editing Tables.
The current method to edit tables requires shifting through a sea of 464 personas with no names in 010 editor.
I can only imagine how intimidating it is for someone who wants to Mod P5R but saw 010 editor, so I'm making this App.

Current Features:
  - Supports 2 Tables | Persona.TBL, UNIT.TBL
  - Edit Registry Persona : Stats, StatWeights, Arcana, BitFlags, SkillInheritance, Skills/Trait, and Affinities.
  - Searchable Catalogue of Registry Persona, you can search via Index or Name.

TODO: (in order of priority)
  - First Release, deal with any bugs that pop up
  - Party Member Editing : 2nd Half of Persona.TBL
  - Enemy Editing : Segments 1 and 2 of Unit.TBL
  - Skill Editing : Segments 1 and 2 of Skill.TBL
  - Trait Editing : Segment 4 of Skill.TBL
  - I'll think of more when eventually...
